Apply VGG-11 + batch normalization to do multi-class classification on FER2013 dataset.

### Problem: Use CNN model to classify class-imbalanced facial images

### Description
The training dataset contains 7 classes of class-imbalanced 48x48 facial expression images. You should apply any CNN algorithm using PyTorch package and create feature tensors based on the input images as the modelâ€™s inputs and train your CNN models to classify the training data. The training process must not include pre-trained weights. To evaluate the result, TA will run the command `$ python predict.py model.pth test output.csv`. Your prediction should be saved as a .csv file. **The test accuracy must be greater than 66%.**

### Grading Policy
If the testing accuracy of your prediction is greater than 66%, you will receive half of the credits. Other half of the credits would be evaluted based on your ranking on model performance.
